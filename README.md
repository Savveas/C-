Exotic Higgs Decay
Exotic Higgs Boson decay to four b-quarks via W-boson

This repository contains code and data related to the study of exotic decay modes of the Higgs boson.

Overview
The Higgs boson, discovered at CERN in 2012, plays a crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics. This repository focuses on exploring non-standard decay channels of the Higgs boson, which could provide insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.
